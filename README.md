Predicting flight arrival delays is a critical task for airlines and passengers. This project explores the application of several advanced machine learning algorithms to create an accurate prediction model for flight arrival delays. By comparing different models, we aim to find the best approach for this problem.

The main libraries used in this project include:

    pandas
    numpy
    catboost
    xgboost
    lightgbm

## Data

The data folder contains the training and test datasets (train.csv and test.csv). The data preprocessing steps are outlined in the 01_data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling the features. These steps are crucial for preparing the data for model training. The detailed steps are in the 01_data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
Model Training

The model training process, including hyperparameter tuning, is documented in the 02_model_training.ipynb notebook. We use cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimation. The training includes:

    Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
    Training models using CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, and Random Forest regressors.
    Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search techniques.

## valuation

The model evaluation, including cross-validation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculation, is detailed in the 03_model_evaluation.ipynb notebook. We compare the performance of different models to identify the best one.

Results

The results folder contains the submission files generated by the trained models. The 04_compare_submissions.ipynb notebook includes the steps to calculate the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) between different submission files to assess the consistency of the predictions.

## Usage

To preprocess the data, open and run the 01_data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
